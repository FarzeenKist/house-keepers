# House Keepers

My Celo 101 submission on Dacade.
It's a dapp that allows house keeping agencies that provide a wide range of service to list/register their agency on the platform giving people easy access to hire them with a certain amount of cUSD token. In listing/registering the agency, the lister could opt to make the agency sellable and tag a worth to the agency or the lister may choose to stick with being hired only.

To add, listing/registering an agency is free and the agency can tag a hire fee to their service they feel will be worth it.
